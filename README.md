# #system_shell_2#

SMT Shell by BLuFeNiX with a twist of my own UPDATED & UPGRADED. #system_shell_2# will allow you to achieve a `system` shell (UID 1000). This was brought upon me as a challenge to update and upgrade SMT Shell. With the updates and upgrades implemented, you can NOW bypass Samsung's One UI 5.1 patch that was introduced back in Feb but strictly limited up to devices carrying the May 1,2023 security patch and on most watches, a security patch of April 1, 2023. This is something AOSP did to prevent any bypasses resulting in Samsung-text-to-talk being downgraded past the factory apk on your device. See here for more information  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/33940a9749666eec991904094ccf56ae4ca4ae10


#system_shell_2# was kept almost intact except for the obvious changes. The majority of the buttons added, only work if your device carries IOTHiddenMenu. If you have a Korean or Indian variant, you MAY not be able to enjoy the full functionality that this version brings. There is nothing at the moment to change this or get it installed on your device. If you have IOTHiddenMenu already installed, then enjoy. If not, then your out of luck.

## Bypass Method
The method for bypassing the One UI 5.1 was found by one individual. Full credit goes to him and his efforts on making this bypass available. Many thanks to k0mraid3 for his contribution. https://twitter.com/k0mraid3

#### The following is the command that bypasses the FEB patch but stops at MAY 2023.
```
adb install -d -i com.sec.android.preloadinstaller /data/local/tmp/com.samsung.SMT_v3.0.02.2.apk
pm install -d -i com.sec.android.preloadinstaller /data/local/tmp/com.samsung.SMT_v3.0.02.2.apk
```

## Updated Command OCT 2023
The following command is in reference to my #system3 project and its success. 

THIS WILL NOT DOWNGRADE SMT, PAST THE AOSP PATCH OF MAY 2023.
FOR SYSTEM SHELL ACCESS, PAST THE AOSP PATCH, see [#system3](https://github.com/wr3cckl3ss1/system3)
```
adb install -d -i PrePackageInstaller /data/local/tmp/com.samsung.SMT_v3.0.02.2.apk
pm install -d -i PrePackageInstaller /data/local/tmp/com.samsung.SMT_v3.0.02.2.apk
```

## Licences & Origin

This project started as a fork of [SMT-CVE-2019-16253](https://github.com/flankerhqd/vendor-android-cves/tree/master/SMT-CVE-2019-16253), created by flankerhqd (AKA flanker017). There is also a write-up by flanker [here](https://blog.flanker017.me/text-to-speech-speaks-pwned). Due to the original repo containing multiple unrelated projects, this fork's git history was rewritten using `git filter-repo` so that it only contains the relevant code (and no prebuilt artifacts).
